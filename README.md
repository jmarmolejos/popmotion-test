Clone the repo then run:

$ bower install

This will get you the the typesettings framework and the Popmotion engine. If you want to play around with the styles you'll have to run:

$ npm install
$ gulp sass:watch

The first command will get you the gulp sass goodies and the second command will fire up the gulp task that watches for file changes and compiles the scss files for you.
